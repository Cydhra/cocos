# Cooperative Confident Selection
`Cocos` and `libcocos` are a parallel implementation of the 
Approximately Unbiased [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1080/10635150290069913) test for phylogenetic tree selection.
The test is designed for any selection problem that uses the RELL bootstrap method,
but the cocos binary currently supports only TREE-PUZZLE-style [[2]](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/18.3.502)
per-site log-likelihood files 
(which are also generated by [RAxML-ng](https://github.com/amkozlov/raxml-ng))
[[3]](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz305) for bootstrapping.

The library takes already parsed log-likelihood vectors as input and can thus be used to apply the AU test to other inputs
as well.

The library and CLI are Work In Progress.
Currently, they do not allow changing the scaling factors of the multiscale bootstrap process, nor the number of generated
bootstrap replicates.

# Cocos Usage
The binary comes with a full unix-style CLI. Use `cocos --help` to list all available command line options and usage
information.

Basic usage example:

```bash
cocos -i dataset.raxml.siteLH -o dataset.au.tsv
```

This generates BP values and AU p-values in `dataset.au.tsv`.
The random seed can be fixed with `-s SEED`, the number of threads can be set with `-t N`.
If no thread-number is given, cocos defaults to the number of available cores.
